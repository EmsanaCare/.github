# Add a VIP pass to the highest quality care to your employee health plan, so good care is the default choice

We created EmsanaCare to make it easier for employers to ensure their employees receive care with the highest quality providers. The EmsanaCare VIP Access Pass waives co-pays and triggers personalized benefits, such as transportation and childcare, with top-performing provider partners.

By linking a distinctly better health care experience to our VIP Access Pass, employees naturally receive care in the right place, with the best providers â€“ without having to think about it.

We do this by identifying and partnering with providers that meet performance standards set by employers and validated through real-time patient feedback:

* Convenient and timely scheduling
* Accessible and convenient care options
* Respectful, informed, equitable treatment
* Adherence to clinical protocols
* Coordination between primary and specialty care
* Reasonable cost-of-care
